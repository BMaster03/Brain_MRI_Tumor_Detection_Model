# üß† Brain MRI Tumor Detection Model using Deep Learning

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** with a **pre-trained MobileNetV2** model to detect brain tumors in **MRI scans**. The model performs binary classification to determine whether an MRI image contains a tumor or not. Developed on **macOS (MacBook Air)** and tested with Python 3.12.4.
